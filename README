O. Introduction

rnaseqmut is a light-weight C++ program to detect variants (or mutations, including SNPs, indels) from RNA-Seq BAM files. It offers the following features:

  (1) Perform de-novo mutation discovery from a given BAM file;
  (2) For a user-defined mutation list, calculate the read coverage, including reads that support reference allele (reference reads) and alternative allele (alternative reads), from a given BAM file; 
  (3) For a series of RNA-Seq samples, filter interesting mutations based on user-defined criteria.

This software package includes a "core" C++ program, rnaseqmut, to call variants from a single BAM file, and a series of optional scripts, written in Python3 and bash, to identify putative interesting mutations in a group of RNA-Seq samples. 

Besides mutation detection from RNA-Seq, the "core" program (rnaseqmut) can also be used to call mutations from other high-throughput sequencing platforms, including ChIP-seq, DNA-Seq, etc.

I.     System requirements, Compiling and Installation
----------------------------------------------

1. System requirements

rnaseqmut depends on two third-party C++ packages, bamtools (written by Derek Barnett, https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools) and TCLAP (Templatized C++ Command Line Parser Library, written by Michael E. Smoot, http://tclap.sourceforge.net/). The source codes of both packages are included in rnaseqmut source code.

To run the "core" program, only C++ compiler (gcc version >4.1) is needed. To use the supplementary scripts including demo, Linux system with Python3 support is required.

2. Compiling

To compile rnaseqmut, you need to first compile bamtools. To compile bamtools, go to the src/bamtools dir, and follow the instructions in bamtools help page below:

https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools/wiki/Building-and-installing

After bamtools compilation is complete, go back to the src dir and type

  make

to finish the compilation. After compilation, the executable is in the bin/ directory.

II.    Usage
----------------------------------------------


rnaseqmut  [-l <mutation_list>] [-i <min_read>] [-m <mut_span>]
                     [--] [--version] [-h] <bam_file>


Where: 

   -l <mutation_list>,  --mutation_list <mutation_list>
     The text file of a given, sorted list of mutations. Each line in a
     file records one mutations, with chromosome, location, reference and
     alternative sequence (separated by tab). The output will only include
     mutations within a given mutation list.

   -i <min_read>,  --min_read <min_read>
     The minimum read count for the mutation to output. Default 1.

   -m <mut_span>,  --mut_span <mut_span>
     The minimum distance of the mutation to the beginning (end) of the
     read. Default 4.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <bam_file>
     (required)  The bam file from which mutation will be called
